# React Weather Data

## Prerequisites

Yarn or npm are essential to React development. This app is based on the create-react-app from the Facebook development team.

<a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node" target="_blank" title="Installing Node.js and updating npm">
Get it now</a> if it's not already installed on your machine.

**Verify that you are running at least node `v4.x.x` and npm `3.x.x`**
by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.
Older versions produce errors.

## Create a new project based on the QuickStart

Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., `my-proj`).
```shell
git clone https://github.com/angular/react-weather-data.git  my-proj
cd my-proj
```

## Install npm packages

> See npm and nvm version notes above

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
yarnpkg start
```

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

You're ready to write your application.

Inside the directory, you can run several commands:

  yarnpkg start
    Starts the development server.

  yarnpkg run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  yarnpkg test
    Starts the test runner.

  yarnpkg run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
